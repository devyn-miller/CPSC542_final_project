# Video Colorization Project

This repository contains code and documentation for our Video Colorization Project.


```
Proposed timeline:

April 12 (3 weeks from today): individual pipelines developed; models trained

April 19: training on all data completed; numbers 1-6 in the assignment paper/presentation content written in report

April 26: Rough draft of final report completed with feedback from Caitlyn and/or LaHaye; somewhat decent GUI

May 3: final report completed with subsequent slides based on feedback; GUI finalized

May 3-presentation date: practice presenting, refine as necessary

I was thinking we could set up meetings for each of these checkpoints with further communication as needed. This is just a suggestion so if anyone else has other preferences thatâ€™s totally cool as well!
